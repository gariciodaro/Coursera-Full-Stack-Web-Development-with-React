# Specialization Coursera: Full-Stack Web Development with React

This repository was built to keep track of my development during the specialization.

## Specialization description

Learn front-end and hybrid mobile development, with server-side support, 
for implementing a multi-platform solution.
The first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: 
Bootstrap 4 and React. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications,
 using React Native. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL 
 databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment and Express 
 framework, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. Learners 
 enrolling in this Specialization are expected to have prior working 
 knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
